# OSSU CS Degree Dashboard

A web app that will help students of the [OSSU CS Degree Program](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) keep track of their progress with an interactive dashboard, communicate with other students through a chat feature, and have access to a mentor all within one simple interface. 

## The Vision

* Jedi theme with a futuristic UI.
* Dashboard showing:
  * Students profile with links to Github, LinkedIn, etc.
  * Current course enrollments
  * Student rank
* Ranking system ([Description of Jedi](https://swrpforce.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Ranks)):
  * Jedi Initiate - Introduction to Computer Science
  * Jedi Padawan - Core CS
  * Jedi Knight - Advanced CS
  * Jedi Master - Final project
  * Jedi Councilor - Pro CS
* Once intro to cs is completed, matched with a mentor (anyone who has completed Core CS or acheived rank of Jedi Knight or higher) to verify that work is being completed and answer questions.
* Message board for each class
* List or web of classes available based on progress. i.e. Only show classes that user has completed the prereqs for.
* Dynamic way to update curriculum. (Scrape from github? API's from class website? etc.?)

## Challenges

* How to check for course completion
  * Mini project at the end of each course?
* Updating curriculum

## Contributing

Open to new ideas about structure of the project, theme, curriculum, etc. The more help the better.
